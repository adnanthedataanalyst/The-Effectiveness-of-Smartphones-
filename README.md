#### Title: The Effectiveness of Smartphones on English Vocabulary Learning in Non-English-Speaking Countries: A Meta-Analysis and Meta-Regression

**Note:** For detailed information, please refer to the full study.

**Abstract:**
This meta-analysis and meta-regression study assessed the impact of smartphones on English vocabulary learning (EVL) in non-English-speaking countries (NESC). Analysis of 36 primary studies with 2,423 participants demonstrated smartphones' significant impact on EVL in NESC, with factors such as application type, assessment type, country, and publication type influencing this impact. The study utilized multivariable meta-regression analysis to explain outcomes considering various factors like application type, assessment type, country, intervention duration, language proficiency, and learning context. The findings provide evidence supporting smartphones' effectiveness in English vocabulary learning in NESC.

**Introduction:**
The study addresses the challenge faced by non-English-speaking countries (NESC) in acquiring English language skills, particularly vocabulary, due to limited resources and time constraints. Traditional classroom methods often fall short in providing adequate vocabulary learning opportunities. To overcome these limitations, researchers propose integrating smartphones as supplementary tools for English language learning, offering flexibility and accessibility to learners. While several empirical studies have shown the positive impact of smartphones on English vocabulary learning, existing meta-analyses have not specifically focused on NESC. Therefore, this study aims to fill this gap by examining the effectiveness of smartphones in NESC and identifying moderators influencing their impact.

**Methodology:**
Meta-analysis methodology was employed, encompassing literature search, codebook development, data analysis, and results presentation. A thorough literature search yielded 36 primary studies meeting the inclusion criteria. A codebook was developed to code moderators influencing smartphone effectiveness based on activity theory (AT). Data analysis was performed using R statistical software, including calculation of effect sizes, identification of outliers, and meta-regression to analyze moderation effects. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plot analysis.

**Results and Discussion:**
The meta-analysis revealed a significant overall effect size (RE: g = 0.81), indicating smartphones' positive impact on EVL in NESC. Various moderators such as application type, assessment type, and country significantly influenced this impact. Multivariable meta-regression analysis explained 99% of the outcome variability, highlighting the importance of considering multiple factors simultaneously.

**Limitations:**
Limitations include the exclusion of non-English language studies and those relying solely on self-reported data. Future research should consider incorporating studies in other languages and integrating qualitative data for a comprehensive understanding.

**Conclusion:**
The study contributes to the literature by demonstrating smartphones' effectiveness in English vocabulary learning in NESC. Practical implications are provided for educators, practitioners, researchers, and developers to optimize English vocabulary learning through smartphone integration.

**Implications and Future Directions:**
The study suggests implications for educators to consider different assessment types and application selection for effective vocabulary learning. It also highlights gaps in research, particularly regarding assessment types and feedback, urging further exploration in these areas. Educational app developers can leverage these insights to enhance vocabulary learning apps' features and effectiveness.
